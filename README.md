# Card Guesser
This is my first "project" in C++. Attempting to implement binary search algorithm to guess the users card from a deck of cards.

Inspired by [MIT-OCW 6.0001 problem set 1](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/)
